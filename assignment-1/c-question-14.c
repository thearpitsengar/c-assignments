// The SPI (Semester Performance Index) is a weighted average of the grade points
// earned by a student in all the courses he registered for in a semester.
// If the grade points associated with the letter grades awarded to a student
// are g1, g2, g3,…….gk etc. and the corresponding credits are c1, c2, c3,.…..ck,
// the SPI is  given by: 
// SPI = sigma k(upper) i=1(lower)cigi/sigma k(upper) i=1(lower)ci
// Where, k is the number of courses for
// which the candidate remains registered for during the semester/ trimester.
// Write a program in C to calculate SPI for k =5
